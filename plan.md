Key Considerations for AI Agent Execution
Modularity: Emphasize creating highly modular and decoupled components to facilitate independent development and testing.
Error Handling: Prioritize robust error handling and user-friendly error messages throughout the application.
Security First: Implement security measures (encryption, authentication) from the ground up, not as an afterthought.
Performance Optimization: Continuously monitor and optimize performance, especially for the Camera Device to ensure minimal battery drain and overheating.
User Feedback Loop: Be prepared to iterate on UI/UX based on testing feedback.
Firebase Quotas: Be mindful of Firebase free tier quotas and design for scalability if usage exceeds them.
WebRTC Complexity: WebRTC can be complex; focus on a stable, basic implementation first, then add advanced features.
Kotlin Coroutines: Leverage Kotlin Coroutines for all asynchronous operations to ensure non-blocking UI and efficient background processing.
Jetpack Compose: Utilize Compose's declarative nature for building reactive and maintainable UIs.
